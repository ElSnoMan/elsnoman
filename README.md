I've done hands-on workshops, courses, breakout sessions, keynotes, and more all over the world for the past 10 years. Here are some examples:

> 🎉 I will be keynoting at AgileDevOps in Florida and DevOpsDays SLC in 2024!

Unfortunately, not every presentation or workshop I've done is recorded, like `Tips for Building LLM Apps` at AI Con in Vegas this year, but here are a few recordings:

* [Presentation: Testing Machine Learning Models](https://youtu.be/UHbBU8gz7Dw?si=nXpdPVgFThSNSQRQ) at PyCon US (2022)
* [Presentation: Future of Test Data Generation with AI](https://youtu.be/iYngoCRnM1Q?si=p6pXGG83B8V-BLx3) at TestFlix (online 2022)
* [Presentation: Devs should love your tests](https://youtu.be/MAvXluvVv5o?si=P-p4rQUR7wJ7vNcc) at Selenium Conference (London 2019)
* [Course: Intro to Testing ML Models](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/testing-machine-learning-models/) at Test Automation University
* [Course: Scaling Tests with Docker](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/scaling-tests-with-docker/) at Test Automation University
* [Guest: How to get automation included in your Definition of Done](https://youtu.be/TYBk-KScGuY?si=ydqugwul27le77M8) by Angie Jones at QAP

As you can imagine, with over a decade of very hands-on experience, I have worked deeply with many tools and technologies. I provide many examples below, but I didn't want to duplicate multiple icons like `AWS` even though I have used it in every group you'll see. There isn't a pretty icon for everything I use, like `playwright` and `langchain`, but this should give a good idea of what I know well.

> 🤔 I don't include anything that I don't know well enough, like `React` and `GraphQL`, even though I have written React before. Keeping myself honest

## 🐍 Code

Python is my primary language since I mostly deal with data, automation, and AI.

## ☁️ Cloud and Orchestration

AWS, and its services, have been the main "cloud" I've used throughout my career and I have worked with many databases.

## 🧪 Testing, Automation and Analysis

I have worked with a vast amount of tools in this space for many types of testing: UI, API, Security, A11y, O11y, Performance, etc.

## 🤖 Machine Learning and AI

Early in my journey, I had to build my own datasets and train models from scratch. However, the last year has shown how LLMs have made such a huge impact!

I have built multiple features using closed-models, like OpenAI's `GPT-4`, but I have also used open-sourced models from HuggingFace and even Mixtral!

* LangChain has been my main framework for creating the pipelines and switching models for each step
* LangSmith for observability
* LangServe for deployments
* I have built things using just Python as well, but LangChain is getting better and better!

## ⚒️ Projects you can see

You can see my `6 Pinned Projects` below, but you can also see all the repos I've created for the [QA at the Point (QAP) Community](https://github.com/qa-at-the-point)!

My latest project was the [QAP Job Poster](https://qa-at-the-point/job-scraper) which scrapes jobs from different sources, filters and ranks them using AI, then posts them to the `#jobs` channel in our Slack group.
